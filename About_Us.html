    <h5>About Us 1</h5>
    <p> WIRES (NSW Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service Inc.) is Australia's largest wildlife rescue organisation. WIRES has been rescuing and caring for wildlife for over 30 years and WIRES mission is to actively rehabilitate and preserve Australian wildlife and inspire others to do the same. 
      <br> 
    WIRES is licenced to rescue and care for wildlife in NSW and we have 3,000 volunteers in 28 branches. We receive around 170,000 calls to our 1300 line annually, including thousands of interstate calls where we provide rescue advice. Annually WIRES assists tens of thousands of native animals and plays a major role in national community wildlife education. Normally WIRES has several hundred thousands unique visitors to our website but in the first week of January 2020 we received well over a million unique visitors. </p>

    <h5>History</h5>
    <p> WIRES began in 1985 in response to a glaring need for a native wildlife rescue service. At the time, no organisation, government or conservation group could take specific responsibility for native animal rescue and care. WIRES quickly established a coordinated network of wildlife carers and rescuers and officially launched as an organisation in March 1986. <br> In 1992, over 14,000 rescues were conducted. By June 1997, this grew to 38,000 animal rescues state-wide. In the last financial year WIRES received over 90,000 rescue requests to help native animals in distress and WIRES can now receive up to 1,000 rescue requests for help a day during peak seasons, which are spring and summer.  </p>

    <h5>About Us 3</h5>
    <p> Whilst helping hundreds of thousands of community members with wildlife advice and rescue assistance annually, WIRES also responds to requests for help from businesses, the RSPCA, zoos, government departments, local councils, and the police. <br> WIRES has developed a comprehensive animal database that records information on types of animals, injuries, fates and locations for rescue and release. Continously working on ways to help rescue more animals faster, WIRES has also implemented technology that enables the Rescue Office to instantly contact every available volunteer with the right training, in the right area, about outstanding rescues, using multiple devices.<br> Every year WIRES train hundreds of new volunteers in wildlife rescue and care and we are dedicated to the ongoing recruitment of new volunteers and the ongoing training of existing volunteers. Training starts with the compulsory Rescue and Immediate Care Course, covering policies, licensing, animal identification, rescue and first aid. <br> WIRES advanced Species Courses are available for WIRES volunteers, veterinary staff and licenced members of other wildlife rescue and care organisations. Advanced courses cover; macropods, wombats, flying-foxes and microbats, reptiles, birds, birds of prey (raptors), possums and gliders and other small mammals. <br> WIRES is regularly requested to provide wildlife training for other organisations and professionals working with wildlife. WIRES also offers an extensive wildlife educational service to the community through our rescue office, website, social media platforms, talks to schools and community events. </p>
