You have three main options when volunteering, these include; rescuer, carer or both. Your volunteer work may also consist of administrative roles within your local branch that help support fundraising and branch management activities. If you wish to to volunteer to become a rescuer or career, you must first consider time and equipment. If this commitment is not a problem, there are a varitey of expericed staff at your local branch who guide and support you.</h11> </div>

        <div class="column"> <h9> Equipment is an essential part of ourwildlife rescue and care. Your equipment does not need to be expensive or sophisticated when you first begin volunteering, and you are welcome to collect more over time. A member of the WIRES RICC will provide you with a detailed explanation of what sort of equipment you will require for certain rescues or caring for certain species of animals. Your local branch should have access to some of WIRES' equipment that they are able to loan volunteers, however it is recomended that volunteers purchase their own equipment for their own ongoing use.</h9> </div>
